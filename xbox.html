                    The Xbox One is a home video game console developed by Microsoft. Announced in May 2013, it is the successor to Xbox 360.
                    It was first released in North America, parts of Europe, Australia, and South America in November 2013.
                    It is the first Xbox game console to be released in China, specifically in the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone.
                    Microsoft marketed the device as an "all-in-one entertainment system", hence the name "Xbox One".
                    An eighth-generation console, it mainly competed against Sony's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U and later the Switch.

                    The existence of the Xbox Series S had been guessed before E3 2019, based on a "Project Lockhart", a second, lower-end console that accompanied Scarlett.
                    Confirmation of the Xbox Series S naming was affirmed through early Xbox hardware accessories that some had been able to purchase.
                    Microsoft officially announced the Series S console on September 8, 2020, revealing that it would also be released alongside the Series X in November 2020.
                    Microsoft pointed out that the Series S had been discreetly placed in the background of previous Xbox announcement videos featuring Phil Spencer during July 2020.
